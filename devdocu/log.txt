    install Python 2 (3 not yet supported) to rebuild nodegit
        Error: Can't find Python executable "C:\Users\tobiaswalter\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Python.exe", you can set the PYTHON env variable.
            was because of Python 3.
        still not working...
            npm install --global --production windows-build-tools  ' on admin console
            npm install --global node-gyp  ' on admin console
            setx PYTHON "%USERPROFILE%\.windows-build-tools\python27\python.exe"
            .\node_modules\.bin\electron-rebuild.cmd

            ...now it's working :)
            don't forget to restart the console before rebuilding...
